-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            Effectful, iteratee-inspired stream processing based on a
                     free monad.

-- A longer description of the package.
description:
    This package provides the @Tube@ monad transformer, allowing any monad
    computation to become a stream processing pipeline. A computation of type
    @Tube a b m r@ consumes values of type 'a' and produces values of type
    'b'.
    .
    @Tube@s are coroutines which can suspend computation to yield an
    intermediate value or continue execution by requesting an upstream value.
    .
