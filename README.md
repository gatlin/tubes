Tubes
==========

Stream processing with a series of tubes.

Thorough documentation, examples, and more information are available at
[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tubes][hackage]

This library is by no means unique; indeed it is heavily inspired by the
[pipes][pipes] library. However, the goal is not only to write a correct and
efficient stream processing library but also to explore the properties and
relationships of and among functions, pairs, products, and sums.
